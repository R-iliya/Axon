>> Axon, general-purpose programming language targeting for CLI / desktop

Axon is a small, easy-to-modify general-purpose language prototype implemented in Python.
This repo contains a minimal compiler → bytecode → VM pipeline and a REPL.

I'm sure we all know about Axons, An axon or nerve fiber is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, in vertebrates, that typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials away from the nerve cell body.

A great name representing the purpose of this programming language which is made on Python, the language aims to bring the good old nodes inspired by more traditional programming languages just like Java to the performance of Python, yet keeping parts of python that is Just decent and removing parts of Java that are quite unpleasant to work with!

The Whole Project is still a big prototype trying to get further into journey and is filled to the brim with bugs and space for improvement for now, which is why we always look forward for developers and contributors.

## Quickstart

Run example:
```bash
python -m axon.repl
```

Some Example lines:
```Axon
axon> print("Hello, Axon");
Hello, Axon

axon> let x = 5;
axon> print(x);
5
```
